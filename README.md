# AtomScripts
##### setup scripts for Atom editor

## Installation
##### This installation is written for an OSX environment and assumes you already have the Atom editor installed.

1. Make sure XCode is installed (for the command line tools)
2. Install Homebrew
  - you can install Homebrew by running the following command in your Terminal of choice: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
3. Install NodeJS
  - brew install node
4. Navigate to the directory where you dropped the AtomScripts package.json file and run the commands as outline in "Usage".

## Usage
There are 3 scripts as part of this. You can use all of them, or only specific ones. I've broken out what each script installs:

1. npm run packages-basic
  - atom beautify
  - file-icons
  - pigments
* npm run packages-advanced
  - angularjs
  - atom-ng-attr-hint
  - atom-typescript
  - busy-signal
